				<p>I am passionate about helping people.  Sometimes people who need help don't know their situation can actually be improved. That's where I come in. </p>

				<p>I've always been very empathetic. I can understand people, put myself in their shoes and work out their position from their perspective. I'm not psychic, I'm just observant. I believe that helping people is the only thing in life that is truly rewarding.</p>

				<p>I love problem solving, that's why I wake up everyday. Since no person can do anything great alone, I tend to find other passionate people who share the cause. I love inspiring those around me to do something meaningful and worthwhile.</p>

				<p>I'm a huge fan of Simon Sinek's <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html">"Why, How, What"</a> TED talk. I have always thought about life this way, asking why for everything. I've learned so much just asking the simple question: "Why?". I happen to be interested in how everything works, and when dealing with any problem, I work through it in this manner.</p>

			<h3>My Guiding Principles</h3>

		<h3>Read Some Books!</h3>
		<p>There are some things life can't teach you, that's when I turn to a great book. Apart from curiosity and failure, reading has exposed me to the awesome world of other people's ideas. </p>

				<div class="col-sm-4" ng-repeat="book in books">
